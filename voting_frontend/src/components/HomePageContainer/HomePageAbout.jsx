      The Election Commission of India (ECI) is an independent constitutional body entrusted with overseeing and conducting free, fair, and transparent elections in the country. It was established on 25th January 1950, a day now celebrated as National Voters' Day in India. Established under Article 324 of the Indian Constitution, the ECI is responsible for administering elections to the Lok Sabha (Parliament), State Legislative Assemblies, and the offices of the President and Vice President of India.
      <br />
      The commission operates as an autonomous institution to ensure the democratic process remains impartial and free from undue influence. It formulates and enforces election guidelines, monitors political campaigns, regulates political parties, and implements the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) to maintain ethical election practices.
      <br />
      The ECI is led by the Chief Election Commissioner (CEC), supported by two Election Commissioners (ECs), forming a three-member panel. These officials are appointed by the President of India and serve fixed tenures to uphold the integrity of the electoral system. The commission also works closely with state election authorities and law enforcement agencies to prevent malpractices such as vote rigging, bribery, and misinformation.
      <br />

      With advancements in technology, the ECI has introduced Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) and Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) systems to enhance electoral transparency and accuracy. Additionally, voter awareness campaigns and digital initiatives ensure higher voter participation and informed decision-making.
      <br />

      Through its unwavering commitment to democracy, the Election Commission of India plays a pivotal role in strengthening the electoral process, safeguarding the rights of voters, and upholding the democratic principles of the nation.
